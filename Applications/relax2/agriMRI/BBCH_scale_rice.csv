00;Dry seed (caryopsis)
01;Beginning of seed imbibition
03;Seed imbibition complete (pigeon breast)
05;Radicle emerged from caryopsis
06;Radicle elongated, root hairs and/or side roots visible
07;Coleoptile emerged from caryopsis (in water-rice this stage occurs before stage 05)
09;Imperfect leaf emerges (still rolled) at the tip of the coleoptile
10;Imperfect leaf unrolled, tip of first true leaf visible
11;First leaf unfolded
12;2 leaves unfolded
13;3 leaves unfolded
14;4 leaves unfolded
15;5 leaves unfolded
16;6 leaves unfolded
17;7 leaves unfolded
18;8 leaves unfolded
19;9 or more leaves unfolded
21;Beginning of tillering: first tiller detectable
22;2 tillers detectable
23;3 tillers detectable
24;4 tillers detectable
25;5 tillers detectable
26;6 tillers detectable
27;7 tillers detectable
28;8 tillers detectable
29;Maximum number of tillers detectable
30;Panicle initiation or green ring stage: chlorophyll accumulates in the stem tissue, forming a green ring
32;Panicle formation: panicle 1–2 mm in length
34;Internode elongation or jointing stage: internodes begin to elongate, panicle more than 2 mm long (variety-dependent)
37;Flag leaf just visible, still rolled, panicle moving upwards
39;Flag leaf stage: flag leaf unfolded, collar regions (auricle and ligule) of flag leaf and penultimate leaf aligned (pre-boot stage)
41;Early boot stage: upper part of stem slightly thickened, sheath of flag leaf about 5 cm out of penultimate leaf sheath
43;Mid boot stage: sheath of flag leaf 5–10 cm out of the penultimate leaf sheath
45;Late boot stage: flag leaf sheath swollen, sheath of flag leaf more than 10 cm out of penultimate leaf sheath
47;Flag leaf sheath opening
49;Flag leaf sheath open
51;Beginning of panicle emergence: tip of inflorescence emerged from sheath
52;20% of panicle emerged
53;30% of panicle emerged
54;40% of panicle emerged
55;Middle of panicle emergence: neck node still in sheath
56;60% of panicle emerged
57;70% of panicle emerged
58;80% of panicle emerged
59;End of panicle emergence: neck node level with the flag leaf auricle, anthers not yet visible
61;Beginning of flowering: anthers visible at top of panicle
65;Full flowering: anthers visible on most spikelets
69;End of flowering: all spikelets have completed flowering but some dehydrated anthers may remain
71;Watery ripe: first grains have reached half their final size
73;Early milk
75;Medium milk: grain content milky
77;Late milk
83;Early dough
85;Soft dough: grain content soft but dry, fingernail impression not held, grains and glumes still green
87;Hard dough: grain content solid, fingernail impression held
89;Fully ripe: grain hard, difficult to divide with thumbnail
92;Over-ripe: grain very hard, cannot be dented by thumbnail
97;Plant dead and collapsing
99;Harvested product
